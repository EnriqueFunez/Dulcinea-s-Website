History: 
Our Journey started 15 years ago when Paola Gonzales decided to study arts in school, she was so passionate about pictures and editing that she decided to start offering photo sections to her family and friends as a hobby; so good was she doing it that not soon later many people started contacting her to make photo sections of their events as weddings and graduation, she gained so much trust and prestige that she decided to dedicate to do it as a full time, and after having her first baby named Paola Dulcinea she decided to call the company after her daughter. 
Today Dulcinea’s picture offers professional photography services all over the U.S with thousands of costumers’ approbation and recommendations.
